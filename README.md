# email-cleaner
This script is in development. Right now it can get the top number of senders in a users gmail inbox.
## Setup
This script requires you to [create a Google Cloud Platform Project and enable the Gmail api](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project). The credentials must be saved in a credentials.json file in the project directory.
Create a virtual environment for the project using python 3.9 `python -m venv venv`
Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies by using `pip install -r requirements.txt` with your virtual environment.
## Usage
Example: Group last 100 emails by top senders and decide which ones to move to trash (not a permanent deletion).
>python cleanup.py 100
```
Fetching 100 emails 100 at a time...
